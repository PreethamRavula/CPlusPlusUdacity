/*Goal: use logical and relational operators in a C++ program.
**Find all possible outputs for the given expression
**Hint: there are three inputs, so there are 8 possible input combinations (2^3)
**Which means there is an output for each combination of inputs.
**The expression: (A and B and C) or (A and( (not B) or (not C))) = Q
